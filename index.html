    <h1 class="fancyHeading">About Me</h1>
    <p>I graduated from law school, but I've always had a passion for designing and developing websites and apps. While my legal background has helped me hone my analytical and problem-solving skills, I’ve always been drawn to the creative and technical side of building digital experiences. I find great satisfaction in crafting user-friendly, visually appealing websites and developing apps that meet real-world needs. It's a field that excites me every day, and I am constantly exploring new tools and techniques to enhance my skills and stay ahead of the curve.</p>
    <br><br> 
    <p>In my free time, I love immersing myself in nature—whether it's going for a walk, hiking through scenic trails, or exploring breathtaking natural wonders. I unwind by watching series, reading, or simply enjoying quiet moments of reflection. Spring is my favorite season, with its vibrant renewal and fresh energy. I also have a deep appreciation for horses. I wish to have one someday, as they are truly amazing, with their grace, strength, and beauty.</p>
